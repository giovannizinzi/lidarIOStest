# lidarIOStest
making an app to use lidar on ios. 

Goal: take a photo, get last lidar frame, send depth to cloud run. Most important thing = get last lidar frame accurately.

Longer term goal: since there are not many tutorials, would like to make this repo public and create a detailed tutorial on how to use lidar to get depth map. There is literally no tutorials on this and I wish I would have had one!
